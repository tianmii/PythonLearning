# Gaussian Addition

# 1. List of numbers range(1-100)
# 2. WHILE LOOP popping first and last numbers from list
#    calculate the sum of 2
# 3. PRINT out current numbers being added and print partial sum
# 4. keep track of how many partial sums there are
# 5. PRINT out how many partial sums there were
# 6. Perform Gauss' multiplication which is final answer
#    50 * 101 = 5050
# gauss_addition(list(range(1,101)))

gauss = (list(range(1, 101)))
gauss_total = []
gauss_total = gauss.pop()
